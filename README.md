# Whispered Wisdom

## ‚ú® Experience it live at [whispered-wisdom.netlify.app](https://whispered-wisdom.netlify.app/) ‚ú®

Whispered Wisdom is an interactive, wood-themed UI that lets you access an oracle of inspiration based on your current mood, struggles and desires. By placing tiles on the wooden board, you can create unique combinations that generate inspirational whispered messages tailored to your selection. The choice of wood for the background board determines teh tone of the message.

## How to Use

1. **Select Your Wood Type**: Choose from 6 different wood textures (bamboo, beech, cherry, maple, oak, walnut) in the Settings panel on the right to change the appearance and tone of your board.

2. **Place Your Tiles**: Drag tiles from the palette on the left onto the three slots on the main board. Each tile represents a different mood, atmosphere, or concept. Place them in an order that represents your current journey.

3. **Discover Whispered Wisdom**: Once all three slots are filled, the message "Whisper into the wind..." will appear below the tiles. Click on this message to generate a unique, AI-crafted inspirational quote based on your tile selection and wood type.

4. **Share Your Vibes**: Each combination creates a different quote, allowing for endless exploration of moods and inspirations.

üí°Pro-tip: Turn off dark mode settings.

## For Developers

### How It Works

The Vibes Board combines several technologies to create its unique experience:

1. **Tile System**: Tiles are JavaScript modules with associated SVG graphics. Each tile contains keywords that influence the generated whisper messages.

2. **Whisper Generation**: When three tiles are placed and the whisper message is clicked:
   - Keywords are collected from each placed tile based on slot position
   - The current wood type contributes tone information
   - Data is formatted into a prompt and sent to a Groq LLM API via a Netlify function
   - The response is displayed in a handwriting font effect

3. **Drag and Drop**: The app features a custom drag-and-drop system that allows tiles to be moved between the palette and board slots, including a tilt effect and swap functionality.

4. **Wood Textures**: Wood textures are applied dynamically and affect both the visual appearance and the "character" of generated quotes.

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Deployment**: Netlify
- **API**: Groq LLM API (via Netlify Functions)
- **Design Elements**: SVG, Web Fonts (Cedarville Cursive for handwriting)

### Creation Process

This project was developed using AI pair programming:

- **Initial Design & Concept**: Generated by ChatGPT-o3, which provided the core concept, visual design direction, and initial code structure
  
- **Implementation & Refinement**: Developed through iterative conversations with Cursor.ai powered by Claude-3.7-Sonnet, which handled the entirety of the technical implementation including:
  - Wood texture handling and wood type systems
  - Drag-and-drop functionality
  - Whisper message generation logic
  - API integration with Groq
  - CSS animations and styling
  - Bug fixes and display optimizations
